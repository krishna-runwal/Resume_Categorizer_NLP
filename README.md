In this project , I have created a resume_categorizer which is run on the jupyter notebook .
I have taken the dataset from the kaggle.
In this I used the Machine Learning KNearestClassifier and OneVsMulticlassClassifier .
First I have done Exploratory Data Analysis.
Then,  I have two columns in the dataset first is Category of the resume and in second column is resume.
Then, we have put the ML algorithms for the predictions and made functions for cleaning of the resumes and then for prediction purpose we made function.
